# The first line above allows Unix to run this program. In
# particular:
#
# * ``#!`` identifies this file as a script Unix can run.
# * ``/usr/bin/env`` tells Unix to look for then run
#   a program in order to execute this script. See the
#   `env manual page <http://linux.die.net/man/1/env>`_
#   for a bit more info.
# * ``python`` specifies which program env should search
#   for.
#
# So, overall, this tells Unix to look for Python, then use
# it to run this script.
#
# The second line of this program tells Python that this

# ***************************************************
# mav_control.py - Top-level control for the ARDrone.
# ***************************************************
# This program allows you to repsond to user clicks on the
# GUI you designed. Running it is a two-step process:
#
# 1. Launch the AR Drone drivers to connect to and
#    communicate with the drone. At a terminal, type
#    ``roslaunch ardrone_autonomy ardrone.launch``.
#    Keep an eye on this window; it will tell you if it
#    loses its drone connection.
# 2. Run this program. One method: ``rosrun iamgirl
#    mav_control.py``.
#
# Imports
# =======
# First, we need to include some other Python `modules
# <https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/modules.html>`_
# which provide the ability to send commands to our drone.
# The ``import`` statement accomplishes this; see modules_
# page for more information.
#
# Imports are listed in the order prescribed by `PEP 8
# <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#imports>`_.
